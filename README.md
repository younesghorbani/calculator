# Calculator

This project is about building a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and includes four basic math operations namely addition, subtraction, multiplication and division along with percentage operator. Apart from these, the project also had other requirements which included the ability to modify the number entered by the user, to reset and return the calculator to its initial state, and to handle various situations in such a way as to prevent the calculator from crashing, all of which They have been implemented. It was not easy for me to do this project, contrary to its simple appearance. Not because of the nature of the project but because the calculator needs to be able to handle different situations. Among the situations that can be mentioned is the time when the user enters only a number, then enters the operator of choice and selects the equal key. This was one of those situations that took me an odd amount of time and even caused me to rewrite some of the code. I tried to make the code as understandable as possible and add comments to the parts that might seem complicated so that how it works is understandable to me and anyone reviewing the code. Anyway, doing this project for me was full of fun and full of things to learn and gain experience.
